PROBLEM TITLE : Row with max 1s
PROBLEM DIFFICULTY : Medium
PLATFORM NAME : GeeksForGeeks
PROBLEM LINK : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/row-with-max-1s0023/1

SOLUTION : 

class Solution {
 public int rowWithMax1s(int arr[][]) {
    int maxCount = 0;
    int ans = -1;

    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        int currCount = 0; // Reset for each row
        for (int j = 0; j < arr[i].length; j++) {
            if (arr[i][j] == 1) {
                currCount++;
            }
        }
        if (currCount > maxCount) {
            maxCount = currCount;
            ans = i;
        }
    }

    return ans;
}

}

APPROACH :
Here, I have used Brute Force approach to solve the problem which have time complexity of O(n*m).
We are counting 1 for each row using currCount and if it's greater than count then we'll replace the value of count with currCount and set the row's index to ans.
At last, we're returning 'ans' which contains the index of the row with maximum 1's.
