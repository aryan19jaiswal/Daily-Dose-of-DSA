PROBLEM TITLE : Reverse a String
PROBLEM DIFFICULTY : Basic
PLATFORM NAME : GeeksForGeeks
PROBLEM LINK : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/reverse-a-string/1

SOLUTION : 
class Solution 
{
    public static String reverseString(String s) 
    {
        return new StringBuilder(s).reverse().toString();
    }
}

APPROACH :
Here, I have used a StringBuilder class and converted the existing string into StringBuilder.
After that, I have used the functions of StringBuilder to reverse the contents and then convert it into String.
After doing all that on the same line, I'm returning it.
